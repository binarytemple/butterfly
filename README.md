Butterfly
=========

A Scala client for Riak.

**NOTE**: The low-level TCP interaction level was more or less stolen
    from Gideon de Kok's [Raiku](https://github.com/gideondk/Raiku). He
    deserves 100% of the credit for that. This library, however,
    presents markedly different higher-level abstractions in some
    areas.

This is very much a work in progress, so don't use it in for anything
serious. It is, however, being actively worked on, so feedback welcome.

I should also mention that Butterfly is build for compatibility with
Riak 2.0+ and is not designed for use with earlier versions.
